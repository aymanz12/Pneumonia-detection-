# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

An AI-powered web application that detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning.

## üîç Overview

This project uses a VGG-based convolutional neural network to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them as either normal or showing signs of pneumonia. The application is built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
